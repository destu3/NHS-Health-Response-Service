### Starting the Web Server Locally

To start the web server application locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

   ```
   cd /path/to/project/root
   ```

3. Navigate to the `server` directory.

   ```
   cd server
   ```

4. Install all dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   npm i
   ```

5. Start the server using the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Once the server has started, you can access the API endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
